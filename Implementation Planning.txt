# Football Data Implementation Plan

As your tech lead, here's a structured approach to complete your project, focusing on the specific data needed for your prediction model:

## Phase 1: API Endpoints & Data Requirements

First, let's identify the exact Sportmonks API endpoints needed for your prediction model:

1. **Core Endpoints**:
    
    - `/v3/football/leagues` - Already implemented
    - `/v3/football/seasons` - For season information
    - `/v3/football/fixtures` - Core match data
    - `/v3/football/fixtures/{id}` - Detailed fixture information
2. **Specialized Data Endpoints**:
    
    - `/v3/football/fixtures/{id}?include=odds` - Pre-match and in-play odds
    - `/v3/football/fixtures/{id}?include=statistics` - Team statistics (shots, possession)
    - `/v3/football/fixtures/{id}?include=events` - Timeline of match events
    - `/v3/football/livescores/inplay` - For collecting real-time data
3. **Required Include Parameters**:
    
    - `participants` - Team information
    - `scores` - Match scores
    - `statistics.periods` - Stats broken down by period (first half, full match)
    - `events.coordinates` - For ball position data
    - `odds.bookmaker.markets` - For pre-match and in-play odds

## Phase 2: Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Endpoint Handlers (3-4 days)

1. Review existing `LeaguesAPI` class and `EndpointHandler` as templates
2. Implement remaining endpoint handlers:
    - `SeasonsAPI` - For fetching active seasons
    - `TeamsAPI` - For team information
    - `FixturesAPI` - For match data
    - `OddsAPI` - For betting data
    - `StatisticsAPI` - For match statistics

### Step 2: Data Acquisition Framework (2-3 days)

1. Create a data acquisition scheduler:
    
    - Fetch league and season data (one-time/weekly)
    - Fetch fixture schedule (daily)
    - Fetch historical fixture details (batch process)
    - Design incremental update logic
2. Implement rate limiting and error handling:
    
    - Respect API limits
    - Implement exponential backoff
    - Log failures for retry

### Step 3: Data Processing Layer (3-4 days)

1. Create JSON-to-relational processors:
    
    - `LeagueProcessor` - Transform league data
    - `TeamProcessor` - Transform team data
    - `FixtureProcessor` - Transform fixture data
    - `OddsProcessor` - Transform odds data to structured format
    - `StatisticsProcessor` - Transform stats by period
    - `TimelineProcessor` - Transform event timeline to minute-by-minute data
2. Design data validation functions:
    
    - Field validation
    - Relationship validation
    - Data consistency checks

### Step 4: Database Implementation (2-3 days)

1. Finalize SQLite schema (build on provided design)
2. Implement database creation script
3. Create data storage service with functions for:
    - Initial bulk loading
    - Incremental updates
    - Data deduplication logic
    - Transaction handling

### Step 5: Integration and Orchestration (3-4 days)

1. Create main data pipeline script(s):
    
    - `download_core_data.py` - Fetch leagues, teams, fixtures
    - `download_fixture_details.py` - Fetch detailed fixture data
    - `process_to_database.py` - Process raw JSON to SQLite
2. Implement a basic CLI for managing the data pipeline:
    
    - Data fetch commands
    - Processing commands
    - Status reporting

### Step 6: Testing & Validation (2-3 days)

1. Test each pipeline component
2. Verify data integrity in SQLite
3. Run sample queries to confirm model readiness
4. Performance optimization if needed

## Phase 3: Sample Implementation Process

Here's how to proceed day-by-day:

### Week 1: Framework & Core Data

- **Day 1-2**: Create remaining API resource classes
- **Day 3-4**: Implement download scripts for core entities
- **Day 5**: Setup SQLite database and basic tables

### Week 2: Detailed Data & Processing

- **Day 1-2**: Implement fixture details download
- **Day 3-4**: Create JSON processing functions
- **Day 5**: Develop database insertion logic

### Week 3: Integration & Testing

- **Day 1-2**: Integrate components into pipeline
- **Day 3-4**: Test with sample data and queries
- **Day 5**: Documentation and final refinements

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create a small proof of concept**:
    
    - Download a single league's fixtures
    - Download details for 2-3 fixtures
    - Process and insert into SQLite
    - Run sample queries
2. **Conduct API exploration**:
    
    - Test API calls to understand exact response formats
    - Document field mappings between API and database schema
    - Identify any missing data points in the API
3. **Refine the data model**:
    
    - Adjust tables/fields based on actual API responses
    - Focus on capturing all data needed for predictions

Remember to implement incrementally, test frequently, and prioritize the data elements most essential to your prediction model.
